Mostly small, simple Arduino sketches used in the course of developing Laser Tag Robot Tank.

These were in the laser tag robot tank repo but I moved them in here as, eventually, they will mostly be
of only historical interest. Or if I want to remember how to do something basic with the Arduino.

During development, I often ended up discovering conflicts as I assembled components. Libraries would
use pins I did not expect them to use, etc.

I created these sketches to isolate issues. Also to test a single hardware component.

Simple sketches generally use the bare-minimum to get a tank component working, along with printing
some debug info.
